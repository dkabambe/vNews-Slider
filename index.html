    <h4 date="2017-06-11 12:00:00">Initial Release</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is my first publically released JQuery module, as I needed a simple and easy news ticker to fit in with a website I'm developing for a local charity I work with. As I couldn't find what I needed online, I decided to have a go at coding one myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll admit to be heavily influenced by the design of <a href="https://github.com/impressivewebs">impressivewebs</a>' <a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/vertical-news-slider/">Vertical News Slider</a>, as it fitted what I had in mind visually. However, I had a couple of key requirements which led to me coding something myself
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted a JQuery compatible module to make it easy for me to reuse the slider across my site (and on others!)</li>
                <li>I needed something which would work with a (Header-News) (Header-News) HTML layout, so that the page would still make logical sense to readers viewing the site without javascript</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Simple Installation</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Very straightforward to get going - simply include jQuery/jQuery-UI (datepicker), then include this JS file.
        <p>You can then customisable use of tags to fit in with site's existing layout.
        You can also change the speed at which the slider switches to the next item, or turn that off completely.</p>
        <p>The code can be as simple as:</p>
        HTML:
        <code>
        &lt;div id="myID"&gt;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h4&gt;Title One&lt;/h4&gt;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Content One&lt;/div&gt;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h4&gt;Title Two&lt;/h4&gt;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Content Two&lt;/div&gt;
        <br>&lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
        <p>JS:
        <code>
        $("#myID").vNews();
        </code>
    </div>

    <h4>Hover over here</h4>
    <div>
        <p>When you hover over a header item, it will display the relevant content and go back to where you were when you leave.</p>
        <p>Hovering over a content item will freeze that content item in place (stop the timer) until you leave.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Click here</h4>
    <div>
        Clicking on an item will switch to that item, and continue the timer (if set) from there.
        <p>
        <table border=1>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 1</td>
                <td>Cell One</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 2</td>
                <td><strong>TWO</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Row 3</td>
                <td><em>As you can see can include your own HTML in the content sections!</em></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Options</h4>
    <div>
        <h4>headerTag: 'h4'</h4>
        HTML tag which defines the header.

        <h4>headerWidth: ''</h4>
        Reserved for future use, (to enable user to define width of header boxes)
        
        <h4>dateAttr: 'date'</h4>
        Atrribute on the header HTML tag which contains timestamp for the news item. 
        
        <h4>contentTag: 'div'</h4>
        HTML tag which defines the content.
        
        <h4>contentWidth: ''</h4>
        Reserved for future use, (to enable user to define width of content box)
        
        <h4>headerClass: ''</h4>
        Reserved for future use, (to enable users to apply custom styles to header items)
        
        <h4>contentClass: ''</h4>
        Reserved for future use, (to enable users to apply custom styles to content items)
        
        <h4>dateFormat: 'd M yy'</h4>
        Output format for the date, (using <a href="http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-formatDate">JQuery UI Datepicker formats</a>).
        
        <h4>selected: 0</h4>
        Which news item should be selected on start-up, (esp. useful when ticker set to static via speed: 0)

        <h4>speed: 5000</h4>
        Time (in ms) between switching slides. Set to 0 to turn off the ticker and have static display
    </div>

    <h4>Future</h4>
    <div>
        I never really intended to release this publically, but given that I have I am now planning to make some alterations. In particular:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Make JQuery-UI.Datepicker reliance optional (currently only used to format dates)<sup>*</sup></em></li>
            <li>Tidy up code (naming conventions, error checking etc..)</li>
            <li>Further options (customisable width, #items displayed, maxHeight control)</li>
            <li>Create some methods to control ticker programatically</li>
            <li>Put in transition options for switching between items.</li>
            <li>Documentation / Comments !!</li>
        </ul>
        Beyond that will mostly just depend on time, and whether anyone besides myself ends up using this and what they want to see!
        <p><sup>*</sup>Given my primary intention was to make a very lightweight slider this is my first goal. I was already using JQuery UI in my site, so didn't matter there but for portability this is my primary aim.</p>
